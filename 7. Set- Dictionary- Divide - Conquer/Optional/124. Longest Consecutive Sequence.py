# 124. Longest Consecutive Sequence
# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

# Example
# Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
# The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

# Clarification
# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
