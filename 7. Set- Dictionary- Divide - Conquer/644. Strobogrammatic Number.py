# 644. Strobogrammatic Number
# A mirror number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

# Write a function to determine if a number is mirror. The number is represented as a string.

# Example
# For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all mirror numbers.
# Given num = "69" return true
# Given num = "68" return false
