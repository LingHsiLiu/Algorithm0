# 127. Topological Sorting
# Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

# For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
# The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
# Find any topological order for the given graph.
